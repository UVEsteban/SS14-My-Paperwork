▀█▄▄█▀ Officer C. Voskoville Malet

──────────────────────────────────────────

On [color=red][bold]██-██-25██[/bold][/color], Officer Ciro Voskoville Malet was deployed as part of a Security response to a confirmed Syndicate attack involving an improvised explosive device within station-controlled territory.

During the incident, Officer Malet sustained catastrophic [color=red][bold]multi-system trauma[/bold][/color]. Documented injuries included severe blast damage, critical airloss, and internal injuries exceeding the immediate treatment capacity of Brig Medical resources.

[color=red][bold]Emergency medical response[/bold][/color] was initiated by multiple Security and Medical-adjacent personnel. [color=red][bold]Due to elevated stress, time pressure, and the absence of unified medical command, treatment[/bold][/color] actions were conducted without coordinated triage assessment. Officer Malet was [color=red][bold]moved repeatedly between treatment locations[/bold][/color]. This included [color=red][bold]premature revival attempts and multiple removals from morgue cold storage[/bold][/color] before appropriate medical thresholds were achieved.

At ██:██ station time, Officer Malet experienced [color=red][bold]full cardiac and respiratory arrest[/bold][/color]. Officer Malet was clinically [color=red][bold]deceased[/bold][/color] for approximately [color=red][bold]██ minutes[/bold][/color]. Following confirmation of non-responsiveness, he was placed into morgue cold storage to [color=red][bold]limit tissue degradation[/bold][/color] while adequate medical preparation was underway.

This correct stabilization action was subsequently [color=red][bold]overridden by third parties[/bold][/color] acting independently. Officer Malet was removed from cold storage [color=red][bold]multiple times[/bold][/color] during the period of clinical death and early revival preparation. These [color=red][bold]interruptions[/bold][/color] resulted in repeated [color=red][bold]environmental exposure[/bold][/color] and significantly aggravated hypoxic and [color=red][bold]neurological damage[/bold][/color].

At ██:██ station time, Officer Malet was [color=red][bold]successfully revived[/bold][/color]. following [color=red][bold]delayed[/bold][/color]. but properly executed medical intervention.

Long-term outcomes include [color=red][bold]permanent loss of speech[/bold][/color]., attributed to combined [color=red][bold]hypoxic injury[/bold][/color]. sustained during the period of [color=red][bold]clinical death[/bold][/color]. and blast-related [color=red][bold]neurological trauma[/bold][/color]..

[head=3]Post-incident review identifies the following primary aggravating factors:[head]
[bold]
• Overcommitment without reassessment

• Misinterpretation of morgue storage as treatment termination

• Repeated interruption of appropriate stabilization procedures
