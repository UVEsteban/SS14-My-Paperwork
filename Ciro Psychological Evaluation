This addendum supplements the prior psychological evaluation of Officer [bold]Ciro Voskoville Malet[/bold] and addresses observed [bold]procedural aversions[/bold] and [bold]emergency-response behavior[/bold].

Officer Malet exhibits a pronounced [bold]aversion to open liquid containers[/bold], [bold]large-volume jugs[/bold], and [bold]syringe-based administration[/bold] when sealed alternatives are available. This aversion is [bold]not phobic[/bold] in nature and [bold]does not impair functionality[/bold]. It is directly associated with [bold]trauma-linked recall[/bold] of medication spillage, dosage uncertainty, and loss of viable treatment resources during his own [bold]near-fatal incident[/bold].

Officer Malet demonstrates a strong preference for [bold]sealed, countable, and inventory-controlled delivery systems[/bold], specifically [bold]topical medical patches[/bold]. This preference is cognitively reinforced by emphasis on [bold]resource accountability[/bold], [bold]emergency readiness[/bold], and [bold]prevention of secondary treatment failure[/bold] caused by accidental loss or contamination.

Psychological assessment confirms a deliberate [bold]refusal to run during emergencies[/bold]. Officer Malet consistently selects [bold]controlled movement[/bold] under time pressure. This behavior is intentional and rooted in [bold]learned risk mitigation[/bold]. Rapid movement is cognitively associated with [bold]increased error rates[/bold], [bold]dropped equipment[/bold], [bold]improper dosing[/bold], and [bold]loss of situational awareness[/bold].

Observed [bold]laughter[/bold] and [bold]outward calm[/bold] during high-stress events function as [bold]adaptive coping mechanisms[/bold], regulating internal stress response and preserving [bold]procedural clarity[/bold]. There is [bold]no evidence[/bold] of emotional detachment, recklessness, or diminished empathy.


These traits are [bold]consistent[/bold], [bold]non-escalating[/bold], and [bold]situationally appropriate[/bold]. [bold]No corrective psychological action is recommended[/bold].

Conclusion:
Officer Malet’s aversions and behaviors are [bold]adaptive[/bold], [bold]trauma-informed[/bold], and [bold]operationally beneficial[/bold] within Brig Medical contexts. [bold]Continued accommodation[/bold] of procedural preferences is advised.
